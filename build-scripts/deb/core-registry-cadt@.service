# Core Registry CADT init file for systemd. To start the Core Registry CADT service
# using systemd, execute `systemctl start core-registry-cadt@<USERNAME>`
# where <USERNAME> is the Linux user you wish to run
# CADT as. Normally you'll run Core Registry CADT on the same system
# as the Chia Wallet and Data Layer and you need to run
# Core Registry CADT as the same user as Chia.
#
# For example, if running Chia as the ubuntu user
# with your $CHIA_ROOT directory at /home/ubuntu/.chia,
# then start Core Registry CADT with the command
#
# `systemctl start core-registry-cadt@ubuntu`
#
